Fish restaurant with more than ten years history
Today, seafood is supplied from more than 20 countries. And now, with the emergence of the new suppliers, guests will appreciate the restaurant’s exotic seafood from North Africa, Southeast Asia and South America. Canadian lobsters are replaced by Mediterranean from Tunisia, red varieties of fish are now imported from Latin America, and gourmet cheeses - from Serbia, New Zealand and Tunisia. Live crabs are delivered from Murmansk and Far East, oysters and scallops - from the Kurils and Sakhalin.
