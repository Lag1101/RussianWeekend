This restaurant is a unique project even for Europe, where it is hardly possible to surprise anybody with an unusual concept. The absolute innovation and honor of the restaurant lies in its art constituent. There you can find an exclusive collection of modern art painters and sculptors. Both two spacious halls are filled with luxury furniture, made by Ralph Lauren, the real adherent of simple elegancy and detailed naturalness. The restaurant’s Big hall filled with ivory shades makes a perfect place for close meetings, business lunches and dinners. The Small hall combines leather furniture, colored in lemon-cream and chocolate shades, direct nobility of massive walls, made of dark wood and a weak light. 
Such things, as an isolated from the Moscow rush location, warm shades in the interior and weak light, create enveloping atmosphere, which relieves stress.
