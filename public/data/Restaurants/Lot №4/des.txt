Welcome to Europe’s highest-placed restaurant! The city is left far below, the clear Moscow sky is very close. This place is perfect to enjoy sunrise and sunsets, watching clouds under your feet and see birds fly by.
This restaurant is not only about ultra-modern urban style of skyscrapers, but also nostalgia for the 1960s – trendy, wild, stylish and a little bit crazy. Vibrant juicy colors in the Andy Warhol and Blow Up style create a festive vibe and awaken a flurry of emotions.
