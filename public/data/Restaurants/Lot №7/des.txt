Steak houses for the real men!
We would like to invite you to visit steak house and to try our signature steaks and other meat dishes. You can always choose the piece of meat which will become your steak. For this purpose we have our “meat list” – a tray presenting all types of steaks from the menu. The waiter will tell you about the features of each steak in detail, and you will easily choose the one you like. Also the menu of Bison steak houses offers dishes which cannot be found anywhere else in Moscow: our signature lamb stew, oxtail soup, beef tenderloin tartare, Wagyu steaks, signature burgers and much more.
