Mystical Moscow
A few minutes walk from Red Square and St. Basil's Cathedral and you will find yourself in the vicinity of complete mystery, urban legends and myths. You will see how Moscow looked in the nineteenth century, take a ride on an old tram and listen to amazing stories about ghosts, famous criminals and eccentric merchants. If you want to understand the local culture, then feel it from your own experience. Mystical Moscow is one of the best ways to do this. You will see:
The hill of St. John, a quiet place in the center of the city, imbued with a pre-revolutionary spirit
Khokhlovka, a haven of Russian hipsters and street art
Hitrovka, the most terrible district of Moscow in the nineteenth century: criminals, brothels and alcohol
