The mansion located at 58 Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street used to belong to professor I.N. Rozanov, and was a good example of architectural classicism. In the modern era, it's been transformed into a luxurious restaurant which doesn't mess with tradition. The unity of time, space and action are the pillars of classicism. Through the efforts of the team of its creators, the restaurant has become achieved the winning combination of cozy interior, good atmosphere and quality Russian cuisine. But instead of talking about Siberia's cuisine, you should try it in person. Yet, the quality of the food should be mentioned.
You can try any dishes here without doubting the quality of the ingredients, as most of them are organic. Never uses food products containing preservatives, flavor enhancers, artificial coloring or other chemical additives. Chef Mikhail Simagin is meticulous in ensuring that food products are bought only from reputable suppliers who breed them in a natural way. His guests are treated to wild fish, not those bred in artificial pools where they are fed with growth hormones. The desserts have no scary bright colors, but rather the hues are set only by vegetables and pot liquors. Always remembers that ingredients should not only be fresh and tasty, but also natural. You should absolutely try the dressed herring, pelmeni with Chili sea bass and green pea sauce, as well as the Russian pie with domestic duck and quail.
The restaurant’s interior is designed to produce maximal comfort and coziness for every guest. Club is laid out in major sections, balconies, chimney areas, and an open summer gallery on the roof. Thus, there are comfortable places for a variety of settings and occasions, ranging from a noisy party to a secluded intimate meal. Siberia's color palette sticks with the reserved tone of the entire concept. The combination of beige, grey and brown hues will not distract you from the most important thing, each other.
