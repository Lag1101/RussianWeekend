Modern wine shops-bars.
The name "B and W" perfectly reflects the essence of the bar store, where you can easily pick up a good wine, take it with you, or at the same price try it on the spot.
The menu is small and confined to wine: bruschettes, cheese and meat plates, salads, tartars and burgers, steaks.
The brand-sommelier "B and W" did a great job and made an excellent selection of wines. Prices - a record low.
