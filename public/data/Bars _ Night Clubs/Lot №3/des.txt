City Bar & Restaurant is one of the highest panoramic bars in Moscow regularly taking top positions in the most prestigious ratings in a bar world. Located on the 34th floor of Moscow's five-star hotel Swissotel Krasnye Holmy, City Bar & Restaurant reminds a classic flying saucer landing on the top of a sky-scrapper.
It will take you only few seconds to rise above the immense landscapes of the Russian capital by a high-speed elevator. Like a palm of your hand you will see a dark line of Moscow River, spires of sky-scrappers, highlighted walls of the ancient Novospassky monastery, a thin silhouette of Ostankino TV Tower and night city lights from a height of 140 meters. With a 360-degree panoramic view of the city everyone can choose his favorite Moscow view.
City Bar & Restaurant is also unique for its variety of cocktails: cold or hot, classic or molecular.
