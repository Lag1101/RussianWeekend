You got into one of the offices of Stalin many years after his death. Perhaps you know that he was a paranoiac, and no one ever really knew what kind of office he was in, slept and spent his free time. Because of this same paranoia, he did not like uninvited guests. So as soon as you come in, the door slammed shut and in an hour everything will fly up into the air. You have exactly one hour to be saved!
